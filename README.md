# Technical Challenge

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed for a data science technical challenge to develop a classification model that predicts the cancellation rates of hotel reservations over time.

## Features

- Data Handling: Downloads and preprocesses a dataset, including extracting compressed files and handling missing values.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the dataset.

- Feature Engineering: Applies transformations such as encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features.

- Model Training: Implements multiple machine learning models, including ensemble methods, using scikit-learn.

- Hyperparameter Optimization: Utilizes Optuna for automated tuning of model parameters.

- Model Evaluation: Assesses model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
